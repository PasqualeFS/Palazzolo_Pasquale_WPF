// area of a triangle is half the width times the height

var width = 4; // This would actually be the full width of a rectangle
var height = 5; // This is the full height of a rectangle
var area = width/2 * height; //This carries out the correct division and multiplication to acquire the triangle dimensions
console.log(area); // This prints the result in the console
