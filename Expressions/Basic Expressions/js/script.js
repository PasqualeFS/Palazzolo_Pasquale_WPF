// This is the js file for the Expressions Screencast


var a = 2; // declaring a as variable and defining as 2
var b;
b = a + 3; // adds 3 to a
// Commenting this out a + 3;
// Originally, the line above added 3 to the "a" variable but does not store it

//if we want to add to a and change it, we need to use an assignment operator

// Commenting out a = a + 3; We need to add an assignment
console.log(a); // printing a in the console
console.log(b); // printing b in the console
