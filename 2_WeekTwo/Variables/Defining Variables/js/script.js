// This is the js file for the Defining Variables Screencast

var age; //declaration
age = 39; //definition
//storage container = value

var yearOfBirth = 1970; //declaring and defining on the same line

// if declaring separately from defining, make sure the declaration comes first in your code
// spacing is a formality.  Verticle or horizontal space doesn't really matter.  Keep it neat so it all makes sense to
// you and to others who may read your code in the future.
