<div class="introParagraph">
    <p>I currently work in email marketing for the travel industry.  Each day I design emails and code them with HTML and inline styles.  Due to the smaller size of email preview panes, we design for a maximum width of 600 pixels.  There's a good deal of calculation involved in all of this.  You find yourself checking and re-checking your container widths making sure the total doesn't exceed 600 from left to right.</p>

    <p>This is a basic calculator designed to calculate leftover space to be utilized.</p>
